# Spotify-clone
The Spotify clone is a simplified web-based music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a visually appealing user interface styled with CSS, including a song list section, and a sticky bottom player for media controls. Users can play a list of songs, displayed with album covers, song titles, and play durations. Interactive functionalities are implemented with JavaScript, allowing users to play, pause, and navigate through tracks seamlessly. The progress bar reflects the current playback status, and dynamic updates to the currently playing song enhance the user experience. The project demonstrates foundational web development techniques and provides a basic yet functional music streaming platform.
